# package.json

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "^5.3.3",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.6",
    "ejs": "^3.1.9",
    "express": "^4.18.3"
  }
}

1. **Bootstrap**: It's an open-source framework that provides a set of tools for front-end web development, such as pre-defined CSS styles, UI components, and JavaScript plugins. With Bootstrap, you can quickly create responsive and appealing websites.

2. **Cookie-parser**: It's a middleware for Express that simplifies parsing cookies in HTTP requests. It allows you to read and parse cookies sent by the client, which is useful for session management and customizing content based on user preferences.

3. **EJS**: It's a template engine for Node.js and Express that allows you to generate HTML views dynamically using JavaScript. EJS makes it easy to embed logic in your HTML templates, allowing you to create dynamic and customized web pages.

4. **Express**: It's a minimalist web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to create web applications and APIs. Express simplifies route creation, middleware management, and interaction with HTTP request and response, allowing you to build web applications more quickly and efficiently.

In summary, these dependencies are common tools used in web development with Node.js and Express to facilitate the creation of responsive web applications, manage cookies, render dynamic views, and simplify routing and HTTP request management.

# What does it teach me?

Well, this project teaches you how to use browser `cookies` using cookie npm and you will wonder what `cookies` are. Cookies are small fragments of text that the websites you visit send to the browser. They allow websites to remember information about your visit, which can make it easier to revisit the sites and make them more `useful` to you.

# Why use ejs and not html?

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a template engine that enables you to generate HTML with JavaScript. It allows you to embed JavaScript code within your HTML files to generate content dynamically. With EJS, you can create reusable templates with HTML and JavaScript snippets that can be combined to build complete web pages. It's particularly useful in Node.js and Express-based web applications, where you can render these templates on the server and send them to the client as responses to HTTP requests.

# why is the css called bootstrap.main?

Bootstrap is an open-source front-end framework used to design and develop websites and web applications. It provides a set of tools and components that make it easier to create attractive and responsive user interfaces. Bootstrap includes pre-defined CSS styles for responsive layout, as well as UI components such as buttons, forms, navigation, carousels, and more.

In addition to pre-defined styles and components, Bootstrap also offers layout utilities such as spacing and alignment classes, making it easy to create complex and responsive layouts. In summary, Bootstrap is used by web developers to speed up the process of designing and developing websites and web applications, by providing a solid and consistent foundation to work with.
