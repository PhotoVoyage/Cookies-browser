# What does it teach me?

Well, this project teaches you how to use browser `cookies` using cookie npm and you will wonder what `cookies` are. Cookies are small fragments of text that the websites you visit send to the browser. They allow websites to remember information about your visit, which can make it easier to revisit the sites and make them more `useful` to you.
